Run `build.py' to generate `Makefile'. Edit `header.ly' to set global options for all output files. Specific settings for different groups of output files could be modified by editing `xtemplate.py', `ytemplate.py' or `ztemplate.py'. To compile project simply type `make' in your command line. I assume that you have LilyPond, Python and Timidity installed on your computer.
